panic!("Could not find libtorch dir.

        If you are trying to use the automatically downloaded version, the path is not directly available on Windows. Instead, try setting the `LIBTORCH` environment variable for the manual download instructions.

        If the library has already been downloaded in the torch-sys OUT_DIR, you can point the variable to this path (or move the downloaded lib and point to it).")
